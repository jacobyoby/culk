## 🎨 Auto-Enhancement Features

The application includes a sophisticated auto-enhancement system that analyzes image histograms and metadata to provide intelligent, professional-quality adjustments:

### Intelligent Analysis
- **Histogram Analysis** - Calculates luminance distribution, shadow/highlight clipping
- **Exposure Detection** - Identifies underexposed, overexposed, and well-balanced images  
- **Dynamic Range Assessment** - Measures tonal range and midtone balance
- **Metadata Integration** - Considers ISO, aperture, and other EXIF data

### Professional Presets
- **Portrait** - Optimized for skin tones and facial features
- **Landscape** - Enhanced contrast and vibrance for scenic images
- **Low Light** - Shadow lifting and noise-conscious enhancement
- **High Key** - Bright, airy look with highlight recovery
- **Dramatic** - High contrast with rich shadows and highlights

### Smart Adjustments
- **Conservative/Normal Modes** - User-selectable enhancement intensity
- **Confidence Scoring** - Algorithm reports certainty in enhancement recommendations
- **Memory Efficient** - LRU caching prevents memory leaks during long sessions
- **Real-time Preview** - Instant visual feedback with hardware-accelerated rendering

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
cd ai-photo-culling

# Copy environment file
cp env.example .env

docker compose up --build

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Using Node.js (Alternative)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage

1. **Import Photos**
   - Click "Import Photos" on the home page
   - Select a folder containing RAW/JPEG files
   - Wait for processing and thumbnail generation

2. **Cull Images**
   - Use keyboard shortcuts for efficient culling:
     - `←/→` - Navigate between images  
     - `1-5` - Rate images (star rating)
     - `P` - Mark as pick (thumbs up)
     - `X` - Mark as reject (thumbs down) 
     - `F` - Toggle face detection boxes
     - `I` - Toggle metadata display
     - `C` - Open crop tool
     - `A` - Open adjustment panel
     - `E` - Auto-enhance image with intelligent analysis

3. **Auto-Group Similar Images**
   - Visit the Review page
   - Click "Auto-Group Similar Images"
   - Review and adjust grouped images

4. **Auto-Enhance Images** 
   - Press `E` for instant intelligent enhancement
   - Choose from professional presets (portrait, landscape, etc.)
   - Fine-tune with manual adjustment sliders
   - Adjustments are cached per-image for memory efficiency

5. **Export Results**
   - Choose export format (XMP, JSON, CSV)
   - Filter by rating or flag status
   - Download your culling results

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion

## Docker Workflow

### Development
```bash
# Start development environment
docker compose up --build

# App available at http://localhost:3000
```

### Production
```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t ai-cull:prod .

# Run production container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env ai-cull:prod
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests in Docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

## Browser Compatibility

**Required for full functionality:**
- File System Access API (Chrome, Edge, Safari 15.2+)
- Service Workers (all modern browsers)
- IndexedDB (all modern browsers)
- Canvas API (all modern browsers)

**Recommended:**
- Chrome 86+ or Edge 86+ for optimal File System Access API support
- 4GB+ RAM for processing large image sets
- SSD storage for better performance

## Security & Privacy

- **100% Local Processing** - No images or data sent to any server
- **Secure Context** - Requires HTTPS in production (localhost is secure for development)
- **File System Access** - Controlled folder access with user permissions
- **No Telemetry** - No usage tracking or analytics

## Performance Considerations

- **Thumbnail Generation** - Automatic downscaling for fast preview
- **Lazy Loading** - Images loaded on demand
- **Web Workers** - Heavy processing in background threads
- **IndexedDB** - Efficient local storage with indexing
- **Memory Management** - Automatic cleanup of large objects

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Modern browser with File System Access API support

### Setup

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Run tests
